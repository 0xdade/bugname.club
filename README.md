# Bug Name Club
The Bug Name Club is an industry-recognized leading authority on the topic of naming vulnerabilities and other bug-branding related topics. Long before the ðŸ˜¾ðŸ˜¾ðŸ˜¾ vulnerability, the Bug Name Club branded bugs such as CVE-2016-7241, named TestyHTTP. That's like three whole years before ðŸ˜¾ðŸ˜¾ðŸ˜¾, proving our dominance and respect in the infosuck community.

## Y tho?
Branding bugs is stupid. If all bugs have a name, no bugs are special. Here's a truth table for that statement.

| Has name  |  Is stupid |
|---|---|
|  0 | 0  |
|  1 | 1  |

So anyways, that's the idea. Bug Name Club will offer a platform that names every CVE using patented, proprietary, machine learning based artificial intelligence algorithms that are augmented with virtual reality natural language processors.

## Ok but what do I do?
You can clone this repo and run your own bug naming platform, or you can visit [bugname.club](https://bugname.club) to check out our naming.

This project uses a Flask web server and the brand new [Hell.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx6k6WR8GRs) framework.
