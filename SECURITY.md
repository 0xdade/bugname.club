# Security Policy

We here at Bug Name Club take your privacy and security very seriously. By not allowing you to give us any information, we're able to gaurantee we only have the information about you that the rest of the internet has too. This information might (probably) include things such as Phone number, dank memes, email addresses, secret messages, medical history, driving record, grade school permanent record, passwords, and pictures of every meal you've eaten since Instagram was released.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities
You can yell at dade on [twitter](https://twitter.com/0xdade) or [file an issue](https://github.com/0xdade/bugname.club/issues/new). If it's super sensitive stuffs then maybe you want to GPG it and you can get that from [keybase.io/dade](https://keybase.io/dade). As of writing this message, I don't think I've misplaced my GPG keys. May the odds be ever in your favor, though.
